mosaics ::= "mosaics" mosaic* "end_mosaics"

mosaic ::= "mosaic" file_name mosaic_part* ";"
	# file_name is the name of the PNG image that will contain the mosaic.
# If the same mosaic_part is repeated, the result is undefined.

mosaic_part ::=   max_width | max_height | max_pixels
		    | min_width | num_widths | take_all_images
		    | image_files | add_image_files | skip_image_files

max_width ::= "max_width" integer	
	# <= 4096 recommended, cf. 3-2 G.6

max_height ::= "max_height" integer 
	# <= 4096 recommended, cf. 3-2 G.6

max_pixels ::= "max_pixels" integer
# Total <= 5,963,776 (profile 1) or <= 8,060,928 (profile2)
# recommended, cf. 3-2 G.6

min_width ::= "min_width" integer
	# Minimum width to consider using for mosaic

num_widths ::= "num_width" integer
	# Number of different widths to consider when looking for 
# best mosaic.  See com.hdcookbook.grin.mosaic.Mosaic.

take_all_images ::= "take_all_images" boolean
# If set to true, this mosaic will include all images that aren't
# part of another mosaic.

image_files ::= "image_files" "{" file_name* "}"
	# A list of the image files to consider for inclusion in this
# mosaic.  An image file is only included if it is actually used
# in a show.

add_image_files ::= "add_image_files" "{" file_name* "}"
# A list of image files to include in the mosaic, whether or not
# it's actually used in a show.  Use this for images you want
# to include to use from your xlet, using the ManagedImage class.
# Each image will appear in only one mosaic, even if it's listed in
# the add_image_files part of multiple mosaics.

skip_image_files ::= "skip_image_files" "{" file_name* "}"
# A list of image files
